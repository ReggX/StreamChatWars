# Stream Chat Wars - Lethal Leauge

## Pick a side

Use Twitch Predictions to pick your side!

You will be automatically added to **Faith** gang, **NoFaith** gang or **NoBet** depending on what your Prediction badge shows (which side you bet on)

**Faith** is for all people with the blue Predicition badge.

**NoFaith** is for all people with the pink Predicition badge.

**NoBet** is for those that can't use Predictions in their region or missed the prediction window. If your team wins, then all bets will be null and void. Don't forget to spam `No points for you pepePoint` to taunt both Faith and NoFaith gang in that case. ðŸ˜‰

The **4th team** is a mixed team: Part human, part robot. The human part will be played by Nagzz, while the robot part will be taking random actions and handicap the human player.


## Controls
