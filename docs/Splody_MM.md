# Stream Chat Wars - Splody

## Pick a side

Use Twitch Predictions to pick your side!

You will be automatically added to **Bet_1** through **Bet_10** teams or **NoBet** depending on what your Prediction badge shows (which side you bet on)

You have a lot to lose, but if you do manage to be one of the few who win, you will be one step closer to getting on that Tier 1.5 list. ðŸ˜‰

**NoBet** is for those that can't use Predictions in their region or missed the prediction window. If your team wins, then all bets will be null and void. Don't forget to spam `No points for you pepePoint` to all the betters in that case. ðŸ˜‰

The **Nagzz** team is a mixed team: Part human, part robot. The human part will be played by Nagzz, while the robot part will be taking random actions (and whatever Suitwo decides to do) and handicap the human player.


## Controls

Controlling your team's character is done through chat commands, all of which are starting with `+`, e.g. `+left` makes your team's character go left.
